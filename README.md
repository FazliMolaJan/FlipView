# Usage

*For a working implementation, Have a look at the Sample Project - sample*

1. Include the library as local library project.
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.VRGsoftUA:FlipView:1.0.1'
}
```
2. You need to implement two generic interfaces:
Pair and Binder. Interface Pair give view information about models for left and right parts of view. Binder - is a kind of Adapter which bind model to front view
